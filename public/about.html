<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an Integrated M.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence with a strong interest in software development, applied AI, and problem-solving. I am currently strengthening my foundation in data structures, algorithms, and full-stack web development while actively working on academic and practical projects. I am also involved in research on aerospace sustainability, which has helped me develop analytical thinking, technical writing, and a research-oriented mindset. Through consistent learning, internships, and hands-on projects, I am focused on building industry-relevant skills and preparing myself for software engineering roles where I can contribute, learn, and grow.
